# filterNHP <a><img src='inst/app/www/packageHex_v2_20210121.png' align="right" height="139"/></a>

Non-human primate search filters.

The goal of `filterNHP` is to is to provide users with an easy way to obtain a comprehensive search filters to use in popular databases such as 
[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), 
[PsycInfo](http://search.ebscohost.com/Login.aspx?profile=web&defaultdb=psyh&lp=login.asp&ref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Egoogle%2Ecom%2F&authtype=ip,uid) 
and 
[Web of Science](http://login.webofknowledge.com/error/Error?Error=IPError&PathInfo=%2F&RouterURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofknowledge.com%2F&Domain=.webofknowledge.com&Src=IP&Alias=WOK5).

## Installation

You can install `filterNHP` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("avrincon/filterNHP")
```

## App

A user-friendly [Shiny App](https://shiny.rstudio.com) implementation can be found at [filternhp.dpz.eu](https://filternhp.dpz.eu).

If you have the `filterNHP` package installed, you can launch the Shiny App from the R console with `filterNHP::run_filter_nhp_app()`.

## Example

```{r example}
library(filterNHP)
```

The core function of this package is `filter_nhp()`. To create a search filter the user must specify a database and taxa of interest. By default the function prints a search filter for all non-human primates, formatted for PubMed. This is our recommended search filter for conducting a comprehensive literature review on all NHPs. 

```{r}
filter_nhp()
```

Or you can explicitly specify the database and all NHPs (gives same result as above).

```{r}
filter_nhp(database = "PubMed", 
           taxa = "nonhuman_primates")
```

It is also possible to create search filters for any NHP taxon or combination of taxa, down to the genus level. For example

```{r}
filter_nhp(database = "PsycInfo", 
           taxa = "Catarrhini")
```
```{r}
filter_nhp(database = "WebOfScience", 
           taxa = c("Papio", "Theropithecus", "Mandrillus"))
```
```{r}
filter_nhp(database = "PubMed", 
           taxa = c("Hylobatidae", "Ponginae"))
```

You can also omit a taxonomic group(s) that occurs within a taxa.

```{r}
filter_nhp(database = "WebOfScience", 
           taxa = "Hominidae", 
           omit = "Pongo")
```

To print a list of all taxa options you can use `get_nhp_taxa()`.

By default, with the argument `simplify = TRUE`, search filters are printed to the console in the appropriate format of the specified database, such that they can be used (copy-pasted) without modification. However, the object returned is `NULL`. If `simplify = FALSE`, then the function returns a character string. This may be useful if the user wants to assign the output to an R object for further manipulation.

```{r}
filter_nhp(database = "PsycInfo", taxa = "aotus", simplify = TRUE)
filter_nhp(database = "PsycInfo", taxa = "aotus", simplify = FALSE)
```
