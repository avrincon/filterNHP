# filterNHP <a><img src='inst/app/www/packageHex_v2_20210121.png' align="right" height="139"/></a>

Non-human primate search filters.

The goal of `filterNHP` is to is to provide users with an easy way to obtain a comprehensive search filters to use in popular databases such as 
[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), 
[PsycInfo](http://search.ebscohost.com/Login.aspx?profile=web&defaultdb=psyh&lp=login.asp&ref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Egoogle%2Ecom%2F&authtype=ip,uid) 
and 
[Web of Science](http://login.webofknowledge.com/error/Error?Error=IPError&PathInfo=%2F&RouterURL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.webofknowledge.com%2F&Domain=.webofknowledge.com&Src=IP&Alias=WOK5).

## Installation

You can install `filterNHP` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("avrincon/filterNHP")
```

A user-friendly Shiny App implementation lives [here] [domain_name].

If you have the `filterNHP` package installed, you can launch the Shiny App from the R console with `filterNHP::run_filter_nhp_app()`.

## Example

```{r example}
library(filterNHP)
```

The core function of this package is `filter_nhp()`.

By default the function prints a search filter for all non-human primates.

```{r}
filter_nhp(database = "PubMed")
```

Or you can explicitly specify all NHPs (gives same result as above).

```{r}
filter_nhp(database = "PubMed", 
           taxa = "nonhuman_primates")
```

You can specify single taxa or several.

```{r}
filter_nhp(database = "PsycInfo", 
           taxa = "macaca")
```
```{r}
filter_nhp(database = "WebOfScience", 
           taxa = c("papio", "theropithecus", "mandrillus"))
```

You can also exclude a taxonomic group(s) that occurs within "taxa".

```{r}
filter_nhp(database = "WebOfScience", 
           taxa = "hominidae", 
           exclude = "pongo")
```

To print a list of all taxa options you can use `get_nhp_taxa()`.
