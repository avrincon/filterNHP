  Each bibliographic database queries its library of scientific articles in different ways. We have formatted the NHP search filters to take these differences into account and search publications by their associated index terms (i.e., standardized database terminology labelled as topic-relevant) and other aspects (i.e., title, abstract, author keywords) that ensure that new relevant publications are detected. Below are the definitions of each syntax used.
</p>

<br>
<b>All databases</b>
<table class="faq1_table">
  <tr>
    <td><span style="font-size:200%;">*</span></td>
    <td>Indicates that the adjacent word is followed by any group of characters, including no character (e.g., the term <i>'galagid*'</i> detects publications referencing <i>'galagid'</i>, <i>'galagids'</i>, and <i>'galagidae'</i>).</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<br>
<b>PubMed syntax</b>
<table class="faq1_table">
  <tr>
    <td>[mh]</td>
    <td>Indicates the search term is an index term and that the search includes all nested index terms.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>[mh:noexp]</td>
    <td>Indicates the search term is an index term and that the search does not include nested index terms.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>[tiab]</td>
    <td>Indicates the search term should be searched for in the title and abstract of database publications.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<br>
<b>PsycINFO via EBSCOhost syntax</b>
<table class="faq1_table">
  <tr>
    <td>DE()</td>
    <td>Listed search terms are searched for in the '<i>Subjects [exact]</i>' database field (i.e., index terms).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>TX()</td>
    <td>Listed search terms are searched for in the <i>'All Text'</i> database field.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<br>
<b>Web of Science syntax</b>
<table class="faq1_table">
  <tr>
    <td>TS=()</td>
    <td>Listed search terms are searched for in the <i>'Topic'</i> database field (searches by title, abstract, author keywords, and Keywords Plus<sup>a</sup>).</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
  <sup>a</sup>Note: Keywords Plus is an algorithm developed by Web of Science that retrieves publications that are broadly related, but lack the original search terms (e.g., detects publications with terms of other mammal species, but no NHP terms). Please note that this algorithm may increase the time necessary to filter search results for directly topic-relevant publications.
