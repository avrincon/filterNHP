  We created the search filters of filterNHP to maximize the number of potentially relevant publications, because literature reviews may reach biased conclusions if missing relevant publications. Therefore, we included terms that may also be used to characterize other non-primate species (e.g., double-usage of common names), which, as result, are also retrieved. Publications irrelevant to the topic you are interested in can be filtered out during search result screening phase or by adapting the filters to be more specific (e.g., removing the common name if all relevant publications are detected by the genus name). We highly encourage you to review the search filters created by filterNHP and adapt them to your own specific needs.
