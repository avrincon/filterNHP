  We created search filters that maximize the number of potentially relevant publications because literature reviews may reach biased conclusions if they are missing relevant publications. Therefore, we included terms that are commonly used to refer to NHPs, but may also reference other nouns. For example, we include the term <i>'monkey'</i> in the comprehensive NHP search filter, although it may also be used to refer to a <i>'monkey wrench'</i> or the <i>'monkey orchid'</i>. As a result, publications unrelated to NHPs may be retrieved. Publications irrelevant to the topic you are interested in can be filtered out during search result screening phase. We encourage users to review the search filters created by filterNHP and adapt them to their own specific needs.
